- First, prepare you files. Make sure you name your files using the following convention: ``stat547c-fa2014-15-[assignmentx]-[student-id].pdf`` For example, name your file ``stat547c-fa2014-15-assignment1-123456.pdf`` if you are handing-in the first assignment and your student id is 123456. If you are handing-in both a pdf and additional files (source code for example), submit two separate files: a pdf, and a zip containing the rest. Use the same naming convention for the zip file (e.g. ``stat547c-fa2014-15-assignment1-123456.zip``)
- Second, go to the following URL: [http://dropitto.me/bouchard](http://dropitto.me/bouchard) and use the password ``bayes`` (no capitals). You will see an upload button after login.
- You can submit several times by using a suffix ``-v2``, ``-v3``, etc. Just make sure to notify Seong.
