title: "Tentative date for midterm"
---

The tentative day for the in class midterm is Wednesday October 29. Since there will not be make-up midterm exams, please contact me before October 6 if you cannot make it to this date. At that point, if the date is good with everybody, I will freeze the day of the midterm to be October 29 (same time and place as the usual lecture).
