title: "Final project"
---


Instructions
------------

The course project involves independent work on a topic of your choice, with the constraint that you should make use of some of the theory covered in class or in the book, or extension of these techniques. There are three types of projects: application, survey, and methodology. These will be described in more detail in class. Come talk to me if you want to get more information earlier in the semester.

Teams
-----

Teams of two are encourage, but the assignment can also be done individually. My expectation will grow roughly linearly with the team size. You should also declare in the final report who did what.


First milestone
---------------

Please drop me a email by November 16, if possible, describing in one or two paragraphs what is your plan for the projectâ€”this is so that you can get early feedback. Only one email per team is necessary.


Final deadline
--------------

The final deadline is December 15. Please submit electronically your final project using the same method as the assignments, but also confirm by email with Seong and I. Note that I will not be able to extend this deadline unfortunately since the grades are due shortly after.


Format
------

5 pages for individuals, 9 pages for pairs.
