Syllabus: Topics in Probability
===============================

**Description:** A graduate level course in probability with an emphasis on how the theory is applied in statistics, for example to construct statistical models (the important roles of independence, multivariate random variables, and stochastic processes), and to invert them (illustrative Monte Carlo applications). We will cover a range of topics mainly from a user's point of view, starting from language and foundation (sigma-algebras, measures), and then focussing on convergence theorems, characteristic functions, conditioning, Poisson processes, Markov chains, and martingales.
	
**Prerequisite:** Ideally, one upper division undergraduate course in probability, and one in analysis. Co-requisite: STAT 460 / 560 or equivalent. If you are unsure, contact me by email with your (unofficial) graduate and undergraduate transcripts attached.

**Important notes:**

- Discussion forum: To encourage richer open exchanges, Seong and I will *only* use this platform to answer course-related questions (unless for personal matters). See ``Contact`` link in the top menu.

**Evaluation:** See slides from the first lecture.
